# Multithreaded-Elevator

This is a multithreaded program which simulates passengers and elevator travel. There is one thread per elevator, and one thread per passenger. There is a fixed number of passengers, that embark on a number of trips each. These threads interact with each other through a central elevator controller.

## LEADERSHIP: 
The group agreed on collective leadership, and there was no need for a team leader. We agreed on the dates to meet and the execution processing.



## THOUGHT PROCESS AND PROBLEM IMPLEMENTATION: 

First, we got into a meeting where we got the assignment question broken down into chunks for better understanding. We used Lucid chart application for the question breakdown, and we proceeded to meet in person to write the programme pseudocode.
https://lucid.app/lucidchart/fd07e48c-4cb3-4da5-9dc8-5e4d715bfb5a/edit?viewport_loc=-194%2C137%2C1792%2C825%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_cc29dc76-2961-420d-9102-896bc034f367

From the breakdown, we concluded that the question could be broken down into 3 segments; the elevator, the passenger, execution/linkers

We agreed that it would be easier to write the code for the programme if we first understood the question by breaking it down before proceeding with anything. Fortunately, that strategy helped us better understand the question, which in return helped us in writing the pseudocode.

For the pseudocode, we discussed the necessary functions, these are the functions that our programme would contain. These functions are named so that it is easy for anyone to understand what they are used for because it is group work.


## GitHub: 
We created a GitHub repository where the collaboration was done. We had 3 different branches for each team member and one main branch. We did this to avoid any code clash so that whatever is being pushed to the main branch is what we(the whole group) agreed on.

## Task Assigning: 
The tasks are assigned based on the 3 segments mentioned above.
